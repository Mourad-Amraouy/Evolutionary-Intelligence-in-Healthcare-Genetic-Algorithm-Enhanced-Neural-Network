# Evolutionary Intelligence in Healthcare: Genetic Algorithm-Enhanced Neural Network for Diabetes Prediction
In this groundbreaking project, we harness the power of evolutionary algorithms to optimize the performance of a neural network model. Our goal is to create a highly accurate predictive tool for diagnosing diabetes using the Diabetes Dataset. By integrating the genetic algorithm into the training process, we aim to enhance the neural network's ability to discern intricate patterns and relationships within the data. This innovative approach not only promises improved predictive accuracy but also sheds light on the potential for genetic algorithms to revolutionize the field of healthcare data analysis. Join us on this journey as we unlock the potential of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation to make strides in diabetes diagnosis and management.

# About Dataset
 ### Context
 This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether 
 a patient has diabetes.

 ### Content
 Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima 
 Indian heritage.

 - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
 - Age: Age (years)
 - Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
